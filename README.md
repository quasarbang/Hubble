# Hubble Renderer

## Overview

Welcome to my Physically Based Renderer project! This repository is the culmination of my passion for computer graphics and my desire to understand the intricacies of rendering without relying on specialized hardware. Inspired by the dream of becoming a rendering engineer, this hobby project is my journey into the fascinating world of computer graphics.

### What is a Physically Based Renderer?

A Physically Based Renderer (PBR) is a software program that simulates the behavior of light in the real world to create highly realistic computer-generated images. Unlike traditional renderers, PBR engines aim to replicate the physical properties of materials and light interactions, resulting in stunningly lifelike visuals.

### Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Learning**: To gain a deep understanding of the principles and mathematics behind computer graphics and physically based rendering.

2. **Independence**: To develop a renderer that doesn't rely on specialized hardware, demonstrating a strong grasp of software-based rendering techniques.

3. **Quality**: To create visually impressive, physically accurate renderings that showcase the capabilities of the renderer.

### Key Features

- **Ray Tracing**: The project utilizes ray tracing techniques to simulate the path of light rays, enabling realistic reflections, refractions, and shadows.

- **Material Models**: Various material models are implemented to replicate the appearance of different surfaces, including metals, glass, and diffuse materials.

- **Global Illumination**: The renderer strives to accurately simulate global illumination, capturing the indirect bounce of light within a scene.

- **Optimization**: Continuous improvement and optimization to enhance rendering performance and efficiency.
